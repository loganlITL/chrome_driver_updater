this is to check the program google chrome and chrome dsriver and compare the 2.
if compatable, then proceed to web scraping
if not compatible or not present(webdriver), it should automatically got to the api and download driver to the same folder this program is in.

this may cause issues when it comes to scaling; not too sure how it will affect future releases.
